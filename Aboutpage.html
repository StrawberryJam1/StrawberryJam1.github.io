    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Strawberryüçì! As you can see: this website is about different foods from different countries. Well,
        That is because I love food. Of course, I haven't tried food from all around the world, but I want people 
        in this quarantine who cannot go outside to try these simple; but delicious dishes. I wanted to share the 
        glorious foods that I know with those who are reading this.<p>
    <p>Now, food is my source of energy, and feelings, and temperature. Feelings? Why? It's because food can give me 
        different types of; feelings when I eat a certain; food. For example, Lo Mein, Lo Mein is a Chinese egg noodle 
        dish that contains meats and veggies. Lo Mein makes me happy or misses my family from my father's side because 
        they would always call Lo Mein as birthday noodles because we get it every time we celebrate our birthday in a 
        Chinese restaurant.</p>
    <p>Why temperature? For example, you're under the blazing heat, and you ate ice cream. The ice cream already makes 
        you feel cooler as it is. It gives you so much that sometimes we find it hard to say "Thank you for the meal."
        in their hearts</p>
    <p>My love for food will widen more in the future. THANK YOU!</p>

    <h3>This website is about food. I want you guys to know more about food while in quarantine. I wish to show you how to cook this type of food, whether by a recipe that I wrote or by clicking the pictures.</h3>
    <h3>I want to share more cuisines from the Philippines, but I figured that I share the most popular first; to interest people more. Adobo and Sinigang are probably the most known Filipino dishes, and I understand why. 
        They are hearty and so delicious, and I wanted you guys to know just in case you want something hearty and something you don't know.</h3>
    <h3>I wanted to share more cuisines from Japan besides sushi and ramen. I know both; tempura and gyoza are already well known, but they don't get enough time to shine. Tempura for is something crunchy, well obviously, 
        but it's something so simple and delicious. Ask help from people around you when you fry. And gyoza is a food you can make with your family since the filling of gyoza is something inside a wrapper.</h3>
    <h3>I wanted to share the basics of Italian cuisine. So carbonara, the basics of all pasta maybe except spaghetti. It is so delicious and easy to make that I wanted you guys to know how to make carbonara the Italian way. 
        Bruschetta, on the other hand, is something I've never made nor tasted in my life. But the dish seemed like a "will eat every day" dish. I will still eat carbonara that has cream and garlic, by the way (sorry Italians.)</h3>
    <h3>I want to share more cuisines from China. Now I eat a lot of Chinese food, and I love them, but I have no idea what the names of the foods are. And I wanted to share with you something I don't eat often. Yes, I don't 
        eat congee or "Lugaw" in Tagalog that much. And Yes, Beef and broccoli are called Beef and broccoli. I probably wanted; to mostly share about the century egg on the congee because it's pretty funky by itself, but eaten 
        with something makes it quite good. And I don't think a lot of; people know Beef and broccoli because of the name which, is just Beef and broccoli.</h3>
    <h3>I want to share one of Korea's authentic rice dishes. Bokkeumbap is now something I enjoy now that my spice tolerance is higher. It has an acidic, spicy, sweet, and salty flavor to it. And it's good and healthy. Same 
        with Bibimbap, except it's not acidic and spicy (but can be spicy). Bibimbap has so many basic ingredients that I would have never thought that it was so delicious. I wanted to show you how basic and healthy ingredients 
        be good.</h3>
    <h3>Thank you! Strawberryüçì out--></h3>
